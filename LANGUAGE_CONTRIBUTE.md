# How to contribute to the translations

## Creating a translation
### Creating `lang/xx_XX.yml`:
* First, create the file `xx_XX.yml` in the `lang` folder. It is a file in the yaml format. `xx_XX` is the placeholder for your language code. An example being `en_US`.
* Second, [update `src/handlers/lang.ts`](#updating-srchandlerslangts).

### Updating `src/handlers/lang.ts`

At the end of the file is the `LanguageFlags` enum.

The format for entries is:
```ts
"FLAG" = "xx_XX"
```
Example:
```ts
export enum LanguageFlags {
  "ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±" = "pl_PL",
}
```
Multiple entries example:
```ts
export enum LanguageFlags {
  "ğŸ‡µğŸ‡±" = "pl_PL",
  "ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸" = "en_US",
  "ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º" = "en_US",
  "ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§" = "en_US",
  "ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦" = "en_US",
  "ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦" = "ru_UA",
  "ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡ª" = "empire_Latn",
}
```

## Updating an existing translation
* Edit a language file in the `lang` directory in the project root.
